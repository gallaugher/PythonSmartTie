# Portions of the LED code adapted from the great tutorial for the
# Animated NeoPixel Glow Fur Scarf - tutorial by Erin St. Blaine & Michael Sklar at:
# https://learn.adafruit.com/animated-neopixel-gemma-glow-fur-scarf
#
# Meant to be used with an Adafruit CircuitPlayground Express Bluefruit (CPXb)
# and the free Adafruit Bluefruit app (only tested on iOS but Android should work).
# To use:
#  - Save this code on the CircuitPlayground Express Bluefruit
#  - Run the Bluefruit app
#  - Press "Connect" on the CPXb from the app's device list listed. It should begin with CIRCUITPY
#  - Select "Controller"
#  - Select Color Picker, choose a color, and press the "Send Selected Color" button to set
#    all colors on the tie
#  - If you return to the controller "< Controller" in upper-right, you can select "Control Pad"
#  - #1 does a "Larson Scan" Battlestar Galactica-style back & forth light in selected color
#  - #2 does a pulsing blue in and out fade_color
#  - #3 pulses through Red and Gold (closest I could get to Maroon & Gold - my Uni's colors)
#  - #4 does a rainbow_stripe pulsing strobe. Cue the EDM music.
#  - Up arrow stops animations & shows a single light in the selected color.
#    if the light is already showing, it will move the light "up" until it reaches the "top" of the tie.
#  - Down arrow stops animations & shows a single light in the selected color.
#    if the light is already showing, it will move the light "down" until it reaches the "bottom" of the tie.
#  - Left and Right arrows run the Larson Scan animation faster (right) or slower (left)
